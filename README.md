# 🎵 PyMusic

PyMusic is a simple music player made in Python, created as a study project and out of curiosity about how an audio player works at a basic level.

## 📖 Why does this project exist?

During my daily routine, I realized that I listen to music very often while studying or doing other tasks. At some point, a simple question came up:

> *“How does a music player actually work?”*

Instead of just using a ready-made player, I decided to try **building my own**, even if it was simple. From that point on, I started studying how a music player works internally, which technologies could be used, and what would be the easiest and most viable way to implement the idea.

This process took **several days of thinking, testing, and decision-making**, especially when choosing the technologies and defining the player’s logic.

## 🎯 PyMusic’s goal

PyMusic is **not intended to be a complex music player** or to compete with full-featured solutions already available.

Its main goal is to be:

- Simple  
- Lightweight  
- Functional  

The core idea is:
- Select music files
- Read those files
- Play audio
- Allow something like a basic playlist
- Be a music player to listen to while doing other activities

There is no API synchronization, no advanced features, and no complex integrations.

## 🧩 Features

- Compact graphical interface
- Local music player (files from your computer)
- Basic playback control (play / pause)
- Volume control
- Designed to be easy to understand and extend

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- **Python**
- **CustomTkinter** — graphical user interface
- **Pygame** — audio playback
- **Pillow (PIL)** — image handling
- **Tkinter** — native components such as file dialogs

## 📌 Note

This project was developed with a focus on **learning**, experimentation, and understanding concepts such as:
- Graphical user interfaces
- State control
- Audio playback logic
- Code organization

It also serves as a foundation for future improvements and studies.

🎧 *PyMusic was born from curiosity and the desire to understand how something seemingly simple works behind the scenes.*
